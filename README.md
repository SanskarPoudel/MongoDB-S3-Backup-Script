# MongoDB-S3-Backup-Script
Features:

Configurable: The script allows easy configuration of MongoDB connection details (host, port, username, password, SSL settings), local backup directory, S3 bucket details, and AWS credentials for seamless integration with your MongoDB instance and AWS account.

Secure: Sensitive information like MongoDB credentials and AWS access keys are stored in variables and can be easily replaced with placeholders, ensuring that your actual credentials remain protected and never exposed in the repository.

AWS S3 Integration: The script leverages the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) to upload the MongoDB backups to a designated S3 bucket, providing a secure, scalable, and cost-effective storage solution.

Automated Backup: With this script, you can automate the backup process, reducing the risk of data loss and minimizing manual effort.

Usage:

Replace the placeholder credentials in the script with your actual MongoDB connection details, local backup directory, S3 bucket details, and AWS access keys.

Ensure that you have the MongoDB database and the necessary IAM permissions for the AWS access keys.

Schedule the script execution as per your backup requirements (e.g., using cron jobs on Linux).

Regularly check the repository for updates or improvements and contribute to the project to enhance its functionalities.

Note: This script is designed to be used as a standalone utility for backing up MongoDB databases to AWS S3. It's highly recommended to ensure the security and privacy of your credentials and avoid sharing them publicly in any form.

Remember to adapt the description to match your actual script and any specific features or improvements you might add over time.
